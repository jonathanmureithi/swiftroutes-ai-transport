# 🚀 SwiftRoutes – Smarter, Faster, Cheaper Transport Decisions

**SwiftRoutes** is an AI-powered mobile application designed to help commuters and private vehicle owners make better transport decisions. Whether you're navigating city traffic in your car or looking for the most affordable public route, SwiftRoutes provides real-time, intelligent route suggestions optimized for **speed**, **cost**, or **fuel efficiency**.

---

## 📱 What It Does

SwiftRoutes leverages AI and smart decision systems to:

- 🗺️ Suggest the **best routes** for private drivers based on traffic, fuel usage, and road conditions.
- 🚌 Recommend the **cheapest and fastest** matatu or public transport options based on current location and time.
- ⏱️ Provide **estimated commute time**, **fare**, and **fuel cost** for every option.
- 💡 Learn user preferences over time to improve recommendations.

## 🎯 The Problem

Daily commuters and private vehicle users in Kenya (and other regions) face challenges like:

- ❌ Unpredictable traffic
- ❌ Lack of real-time public transport visibility
- ❌ Rising fuel costs
- ❌ No way to easily compare transport options

SwiftRoutes aims to **solve this** using **AI-powered decision making**, optimized for local realities.
